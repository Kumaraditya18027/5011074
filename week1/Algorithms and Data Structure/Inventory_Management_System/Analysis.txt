Time Complexity Analysis:
Add Product:
Time Complexity: O(1) (average case) - Inserting an element into a HashMap.
Update Product:
Time Complexity: O(1) (average case) - Updating an element in a HashMap.
Delete Product:
Time Complexity: O(1) (average case) - Deleting an element from a HashMap.
Get Product:
Time Complexity: O(1) (average case) - Retrieving an element from a HashMap.


Optimizing Operations:
Ensure that the hashCode and equals methods are correctly implemented for the keys used in the HashMap to maintain efficiency.
If concurrency is a concern, consider using ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe operations.
