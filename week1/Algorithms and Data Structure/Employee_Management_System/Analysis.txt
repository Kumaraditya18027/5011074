Time Complexity Analysis:

Add Employee:
Time Complexity: O(1) – Adding an element to the end of the array.
Search Employee:
Time Complexity: O(n) – Linear search through the array.
Traverse Employees:
Time Complexity: O(n) – Iterating through the array.
Delete Employee:
Time Complexity: O(n) – Finding the element and shifting the remaining elements.


Limitations of Arrays:

Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size, making them less flexible if the number of elements exceeds the initial capacity.
Inefficient Deletions: Deletion operations require shifting elements, leading to O(n) time complexity.
Static Data Type: All elements must be of the same type.


When to Use Arrays:

When the number of elements is known in advance.
When quick, direct access to elements is required.
When memory usage needs to be minimized and operations are relatively simple (e.g., read and write).
