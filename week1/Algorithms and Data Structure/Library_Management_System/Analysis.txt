Time Complexity Analysis:

Linear Search:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of books in the library.
Use Case: Suitable for small or unsorted data sets.
Binary Search:
Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of books in the library.
Use Case: Suitable for large, sorted data sets.


When to Use Each Algorithm:

Linear Search:
When the data set is small or unsorted.
When the cost of sorting the data set outweighs the benefits of faster search times.
Binary Search:
When the data set is large and sorted.
When frequent searches are performed, making the initial sorting cost worthwhile.
